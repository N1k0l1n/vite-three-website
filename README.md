# Personal Website with Three.js

This project is a personal website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a JavaScript 3D library. The website includes interactive 3D animations and objects, showcasing creative web design skills and personal information.

## Features

- 3D animated objects powered by Three.js.
- Responsive design optimized for different devices.
- Customizable 3D scenes, lighting, and materials.
- Smooth performance with optimized WebGL rendering.
- Modular and maintainable code structure.
